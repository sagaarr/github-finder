# github-finder

It this you can fetch user data from github api and display it.

Note- By default the github api provides only 100 request/hr so, it drain-out pretty quickly. 
      To make unlimited request you have to get a oath key for yourself from github.
      It is free... you have to register there using your github acc. and a key will be generated for you.
      In this project I have included my own key. 
      But rather using my key it will be good if you generate your own key instead.
